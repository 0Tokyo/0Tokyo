### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student with over 4 years of self-taught programming experience. My journey began with C++, where I focused on developing desktop applications and kernel drivers. This deep dive into lower-level programming gave me a solid foundation in software development, and sparked my passion for Windows internals and reverse engineering.

As I honed my skills in C++, I became increasingly interested in the world of web development. This led me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where Iâ€™ve been applying my knowledge to build dynamic and responsive web applications. Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into modern web frameworks like Astro, and Iâ€™m currently expanding my skill set by learning React.

#### ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, x64 Assembly
- **Web Development:** Astro, React (learning)
- **Windows Internals & Reverse Engineering**
- **Development Tools:** Git, Visual Studio, VS Code

#### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On:
- **React**: Currently deepening my understanding of React to create more dynamic and efficient web applications.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Continuously exploring the depths of Windows internals and reverse engineering, applying these skills to better understand and manipulate system software.

#### ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning:
- Advanced React concepts and state management.
- More about kernel development and advanced C++ techniques.

#### ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Connect!
Iâ€™m always open to discussions about software development, web technologies, Windows internals, or anything tech-related. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or chat!
