### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student with over 4 years of self-taught programming experience. My journey began with C++, where I focused on developing desktop applications and kernel drivers. This deep dive into lower-level programming gave me a solid foundation in software development and sparked my passion for Windows internals and reverse engineering.

#### ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages:** C/C++, x64 Assembly
- **System Specialties:** Windows Internals & Reverse Engineering
- **Development Tools:** Git, Visual Studio

#### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On:
- **Virtualization**: Currently deepening my understanding of system virtualization protocols like VT-x and SVM.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Continuously exploring the depths of Windows internals and reverse engineering, applying these skills to better understand and manipulate system software.

#### ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning:
- State-of-the-art obfuscation techniques, especially in virtualization.
- Deepening my knowledge in kernel development and advanced C++ techniques.

#### ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Connect!
Iâ€™m always open to discussions about software development, Windows internals, reverse engineering, or anything tech-related. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or chat!
